# E_Commerce APP( React JS Front-End [with Keycloak]) 

Instructions:

==>Packages and Dependencies 
    
     — RUN "npm install --legacy-peer-deps" (When encountering the peer deps conflicts)


==>Keycloak

    — Keycloak is configured to run on port 8080 and the application is configured to run on port 3000.
    — No need to use the keycloak package, the configuration is done manually in the "helpers" folder. 

==>Local Storage

    — I used the "Local Storage" to store the username in the web browser and ensures that this data survives all page refreshes.
